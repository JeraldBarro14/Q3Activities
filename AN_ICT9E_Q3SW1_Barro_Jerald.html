	<center><p>The medical drama series focuses on a group of young doctors at Seattle Grace Mercy West Hospital, who began their careers at the facility as interns. One of the young doctors and the show's namesake, Meredith Grey, is the daughter of a famous surgeon. Grey struggles to maintain relationships with her colleagues, particularly the hospital's one-time chief of surgery, Richard Webber, due to a pre-existing relationship between them - Webber and Meredith's mother had a personal relationship when Meredith was young.</p></center><hr>

	 	<p>Meredith is described as a "dark and twisty," damaged woman who sees the world in varying shades of grey. Because of this, she is an emotionally complex person.

	 	<u><h3 class="text-left">DR. DEREK SHEPHERD</h3></u>
	 	<p>Dr. Shepherd – aka “Dr. McDreamy” among the female interns – is one of the best neurosurgeons in the world, and has the confidence (and sometimes the arrogance) to go with that accolade.</p>
	 	<p> People-oriented and warm, Derek was fun to be around. He exuded self-confidence and charisma, knowing exactly how to work a room. Strong ideals combined with a 'can do' attitude meant that he had a unique ability to drive positive change. </p><br>
	 </div>

<div class="col-8 bg-light">
	 	<u><h2> ALEX KAREV</h2></u>
	 	<p>An egotistical and vain intern, though some of it is a defense mechanism. Alex is aware of his good looks, and often uses his self-assurance to charm the female interns and other women. Yet he's also aware of his own problems and insecurities.</p>
	 	<p> But soon, all of his colleagues found out what a nice and genuine person he actually was, and why his experiences had led him to have this temperament. While Alex's characteristic snarky humor always remains, he becomes so much more considerate and willing to let people into his life, over time. </p>

	 <div class="col-8 bg-light">
	 	<u><h3 class="text-left">CRISTINA YANG</h3></u>
	 	<p>confident, strong, and always willing to speak her mind. Cristina is driven, hyper-intelligent, and ambitious. She knows that she's got the ability to become the best doctor at Seattle Grace, and she's not afraid to show off her talents.</p>
	 	<p> No matter what she was talking about, she always sounded intelligent and perceptive. Cristina cared more about becoming a brilliant surgeon than making awkward small talk or being likable, and that's why she has gained such a huge fanbase in the years since her first appearance on the show. </p><br>
